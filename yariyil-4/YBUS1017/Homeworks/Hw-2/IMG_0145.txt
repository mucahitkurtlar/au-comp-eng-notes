    It had been a terrible journey. He had got on the packed
train at five o'clock in the evening after queuing for hours
at the ticket office and fighting desperately to get on when
the train finally arrived at the platform. And now, fifteen
hours later, the train was standing still in the middle of the
empty desert with the sun, even at eight in the morning,
already incredibly hot. What would it be like at midday?

    He hadn't slept because of the noise and constant
movement of people in the carriage. One group had been
singing all night, another family had cooked dinner on a
small gas fire. He was amazed that everyone was so
friendly. Too friendly, keeping him awake to ask him if he
wanted anything to eat or drink. He hadn't; he'd been too
tired to eat. Now the carriage was strangely quiet as the
people had all got off when the train stopped and were
now standing on the tracks outside, eating and wandering
about, stretching their legs.

    He tried to sleep but the burning heat was too much.
He wondered when the train would start moving again
and whether everyone would manage to get back on.
What would happen to them if they couldn't? That was
the reason he had stayed on the train, the thought of being
left here alone. He got up slowly and walked up and down
the deserted carriage, trying to find a cooler spot but
without any luck.

    Suddenly a whistle blew, a guard called out that the
train was leaving and the silence was shattered as the
passengers excitedly climbed back on. Looking out of the
window he has glad to see that no one had been left
behind. The doors slammed shut and the train shook,
once, twice and then, slowly, its wheels turned and it
started to move again. As it built up speed a cool breeze
blew in through the open windows and he closed his eyes
tiredly but with a smile on his face as he knew his
nightmare would soon be over.
